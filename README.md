# PS Export
___

Have you ever needed to find a several thousand image files and run them through Photoshop? This node script does exactly that. Check out the use case below for a better idea of why it's useful, if you're not already convinced.

## Installation

* Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/barneydmedia/find-feed-photoshop.git`
* Run `npm install`
* Create a folder named `droplet` under the main directory
* Export a Photoshop droplet into the folder
* Run `node index.js`

## A Simple Use Case

I had a handful of hard drives filled to the brim with PSDs and camera raw files. A simple node script to find and process the files seemed the obvious solution. This is that script, do with it what you may.

## Problems

If you have an issue, file a bug report or make a fix for it and send a pull request. Currently the script only supports Windows and OSX, but if you're running Photoshop with Wine I might be willing to make some updates.
